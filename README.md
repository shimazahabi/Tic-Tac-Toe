This project is a simulation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in a console
application (non-graphics). This game is very popular and is fairly simple.

There are a few differences with the classical one:

• The board is square with 16 cells (4 * 4)

• Some cells will be randomly locked (no player can use these cells)

• The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same 
symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

• Up to 2 players can play simultaneously. (For single player, the other 
player can be an AI). There are two options for players:

~ Human

~ Computer

• There are only three possible results:

* A player wins

* His opponent (human or computer) wins 

* It’s a tie! (For equal or impossible score)

For example: 

Player 1 : X

Player 2 : O

# Options
* You should create an account ! You and your opponent can have a win-loss-tie record.
* You can change the default settings of the game. (size of the board (n * m), win status, blocked cells...)
* You can restart the game.
* Ansi colors for colorful console.
* Clears the console.

# Enjoy the game :)
